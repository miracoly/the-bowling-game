# The Bowling Game

This project is part of my Apprenticeship Program at klose brothers. The goal is to fullfill the requirements of the following code kata by using TDD, Test Driven Development.

## Code Kata - Problem Description

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game.

### Example

- X X X X X X X X X X X X (12 rolls: 12 strikes) = 10 frames \* 30 points = 300
- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- (20 rolls: 10 pairs of 9 and miss) = 10 frames \* 9 points = 90
- 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5 (21 rolls: 10 pairs of 5 and spare, with a final 5) = 10 frames \* 15 points = 150

You can read the full description of the problem at [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/).

### TDD - Test Drive Development

The main focus of this project is to write tests first and the code after.
